# Phish-Net Improvement Plan

**Document Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** September 28, 2025  
**Author:** System Analysis & Planning

## Overview

This document outlines critical improvements needed to address accuracy issues and enhance the reliability of Phish-Net's phishing detection capabilities. Current analysis shows significant problems with hallucinations, plain text processing limitations, and inadequate domain trust evaluation.

## Current Problems

### 1. Analysis Accuracy Issues
- **LLM Hallucinations**: The system frequently "sees" typos and errors that don't exist in emails
- **Plain Text Limitations**: Critical context is lost when users paste emails as plain text
- **Inconsistent Scoring**: Large, complex prompts lead to attention drift and unreliable assessments
- **Missing Authentication Data**: No access to SPF, DKIM, or other technical validation headers

### 2. Domain Trust Gaps
- **Institutional Domains**: .gov and .edu domains not given appropriate trust weighting
- **Corporate Domain Recognition**: Legitimate business domains treated same as suspicious ones
- **Binary Trust System**: Current system is either "trusted" or "unknown" with no middle ground

### 3. Processing Inefficiencies
- **Monolithic Analysis**: Single large prompt trying to do everything at once
- **No Cross-Validation**: LLM results not validated against simpler heuristic checks
- **Limited Context**: No historical or pattern-based knowledge integration

## Proposed Improvements

### Priority 1: Enhanced Domain Weighting (Simple)

**Why Needed:** Government and educational institutions have rigorous email security practices and domain registration requirements. These domains should receive automatic trust boosts.

**Implementation:**
- Add static trust weights in `risk_assessment.py`:
  - `.gov` domains: -3 to -4 risk points (significant trust boost)
  - `.edu` domains: -2 to -3 risk points (moderate trust boost)
  - Known corporate domains: -1 to -2 risk points
- Implement in `_is_legitimate_corporate_domain()` method
- Add validation to prevent trust weights from being overridden by false positives

**Complexity:** Low - Simple conditional logic addition

### Priority 2: Chunked Analysis Pipeline (High Impact)

**Why Needed:** Current single-prompt approach causes LLM attention issues and hallucinations. Breaking analysis into focused phases reduces cognitive load and improves accuracy.

**Implementation:**
Create three-phase analysis in `llm_service.py`:

**Phase 1: Structural Validation**
- Headers analysis (sender, routing, authentication hints)
- Format validation (HTML vs plain text indicators)
- Basic encoding and structure checks
- Output: Structural risk factors and format quality

**Phase 2: Content Analysis** 
- URL extraction and basic domain checks
- Language analysis (urgency, threats, grammar)
- Request type identification (credential requests, downloads)
- Output: Content-based risk indicators

**Phase 3: Intent Assessment**
- Cross-reference findings from phases 1-2
- Apply domain trust weights
- Generate final risk score with confidence level
- Output: Consolidated risk assessment

**Benefits:**
- Reduces hallucinations by limiting each prompt's scope
- Allows targeted analysis of specific risk areas
- Enables better error handling and validation
- Improves explainability of results

**Complexity:** Medium - Requires refactoring LLM service and prompt engineering

### Priority 3: Simple RAG Implementation (Long-term Enhancement)

**Why Needed:** Current system has no memory of common phishing patterns or legitimate communication templates. RAG provides pattern recognition without external API calls.

**Implementation:**

**Knowledge Base Structure:**
```
knowledge/
├── phishing_patterns.json      # Common phishing templates and indicators
├── legitimate_templates.json   # Standard corporate communication formats
├── domain_categories.json      # Domain classification and trust levels
└── red_flag_database.json      # Detailed red flag patterns and weights
```

**Integration Points:**
- Pre-analysis pattern matching in `email_processor.py`
- Post-analysis validation in `risk_assessment.py`
- Enhanced red flag categorization with historical context

**Data Sources:**
- Curated examples from existing test emails
- Common corporate email templates (sanitized)
- Known phishing campaign patterns (anonymized)
- Standard security notification formats

**Benefits:**
- Improved pattern recognition without external dependencies
- Reduced false positives on legitimate corporate communications
- Enhanced red flag detection with contextual weighting
- Completely local operation maintaining privacy

**Complexity:** Medium-High - Requires knowledge base creation and integration logic

---

### Priority 4: Cross-Validation System (Quality Assurance)

**Why Needed:** Single-source analysis is prone to errors. Cross-validation catches inconsistencies and improves confidence scoring.

**Implementation:**

**Enhanced Heuristic Validation:**
- Expand `cross_validate_with_heuristics()` in `risk_assessment.py`
- Add pattern-based checks for common phishing techniques
- Implement simple rule-based scoring for obvious indicators
- Create confidence adjustment based on agreement levels

**Multi-Pass Validation:**
- For uncertain results (confidence < 70%), run secondary analysis
- Compare results across different analysis phases
- Flag significant discrepancies for manual review indicators
- Implement "uncertainty" classification for borderline cases

**Explanation Validation:**
- Verify LLM-provided red flags match actual email content
- Cross-reference explanations against detected patterns
- Flag potential hallucinations in reasoning

**Complexity:** Medium - Builds on existing validation framework

---

### Priority 5: Improved Plain Text Handling (User Experience)

**Why Needed:** Many users paste emails as plain text, losing crucial formatting and header information.

**Implementation:**

**Smart Format Detection:**
- Enhance `email_processor.py` to better detect partial headers
- Implement heuristic reconstruction of missing context
- Add warnings when critical information is missing
- Provide guidance for better email source extraction

**Context Recovery:**
- Attempt to infer HTML structure from plain text patterns
- Detect and preserve URL structures even in text format
- Identify quoted text and threading patterns
- Extract sender information from signature patterns

**User Guidance:**
- Add help text explaining optimal email source extraction
- Provide platform-specific instructions (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)
- Show confidence reduction warnings for incomplete data

**Complexity:** Medium - Requires enhanced parsing logic and UI improvements

## Conclusion

These improvements address core accuracy and reliability issues while maintaining the system's privacy-first approach. The focus on simple, effective solutions avoids unnecessary complexity while providing significant enhancement to detection capabilities.

Priority should be given to domain weighting and chunked analysis as these provide immediate benefits with manageable implementation complexity. RAG and cross-validation systems offer longer-term improvements for pattern recognition and quality assurance.

Each improvement builds on existing architecture and maintains the system's core design principles: local processing, privacy preservation, and user-friendly operation.
